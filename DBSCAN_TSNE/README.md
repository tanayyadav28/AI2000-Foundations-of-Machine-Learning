# Introduction

Implemented my own DBSCAN algorithm from the paper: http://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf    
Drawn results of the DBSCAN algorithm with k-means clustering on 2 datasets. Noted the pros and cons of both the algorithms.

Used t-SNE to visualize higher dimensional data (8 x 8 images, 64-dimensional) in 2-dimensional scatter plots. Tried the t-SNE with different values for 
perplexity and iterations.
