# Introduction
This is an assignment for the implementation of Decision Trees using the python dictionaries as the data structure.  
Here I used **entropy** and **gini index** as the criterion to select the best split, with 10-fold cross validation over the **wine-dataset** obtained from the internet.

# Requirements
numpy == 1.19.2
csv == 1.0
