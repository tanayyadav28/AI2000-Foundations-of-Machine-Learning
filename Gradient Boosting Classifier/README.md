# Introduction

Here, we explored the use of pre-processing methods and Gradient Boosting Classifier from **sklearn.ensemble** on the popular Lending Club dataset. Dataset was preprocessed using Pandas. 
The train and test datasets can be found as zip files in the current folder. The outcome of the Gradient Boosting Classifier was compared with the outcome of a 
single Decision Tree Classifier.

# Requirements

pandas == 1.1.3   
sklearn == 0.23.2
